1) Simulate a three nodes point-to-point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped
2) Simulate a four node point-to-point network, and connect the links as follows: n0-n2, n1-n2 and n2-n3.Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP n1-n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents changing the parameter and determine the number of packets sent by TCP/UDP
3) Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N nodes. Determine collision across different nodes
4) Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N-nodes(1-7), and determine the throughput
5) Simulate ESS transmitting wireless LAN. Determine performance with respect to transmission of packets
6) Simulate transmission of ping messages over a network topology and capture the round trip time
7) Simulate a 6 node network to implement dynamic routing algorithm and verify its functionality
8) Implement a method of cyclic data transmittion using UDP protocol
